A Little Cocos2d Tetris Clone by Josh Aburto

With some help from the Puyo Cocos2d chapter in "iPhone Game Projects"

And inspired by Tris.

To Do: Change controls from touch to move to touch to drag. Block rotations. Scores, levels, correct frame rate updates. It's running a bit jerky at the moment.
